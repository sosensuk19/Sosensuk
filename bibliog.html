            Tell me he savors your glory.
            Does he laugh the way I did?.
            Is this a part of your story?.
            One that I had never lived.
            Maybe one day you'll feel lonely.
            And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse.
            Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly.
            And find me again.

            When you're out of sight.
            In my mind.
            </p>
            
            <p class="letra">Cause sometimes I look in her eyes.
            And that's where I find, a glimpse of us.
            And I try to fall for her touch.
            But I'm thinkin' of the way it was.
            Said I'm fine and said I moved on.
            I'm only here passin' time in her arms.
            Hopin' I find a glimpse of us.

            Ooh, ooh, ooh.
            Ooh, ooh, ooh.
            </p>

            City of stars.
            Are you shining just for me?.
            City of stars.
            There's so much that I can't see.
            Who knows?.
            I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you.

            That now our dreams.

            <p class="letra">
            City of stars.
            Just one thing everybody wants.
            There in the bars.
            And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants.
            It's love.
            Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else</p>
            
            <p class="letra">
            A rush.
            A glance.
            A touch.
            A dance</p>
            
            <p class="letra">
            A look in somebody's eyes.
            To light up the skies.
            To open the world and send it reeling.
            A voice that says, I'll be here.
            And you'll be alright.
            </p>
            
            <p class="letra">
            I don't care if I know.
            Just where I will go.
            'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling.
            A rat-tat-tat on my heart</p>
            
            <p class="letra">
            Think I want it to stay</p>
            
            <p class="letra">
            City of stars.
            Are you shining just for me?.
            City of stars.
            You never shined so brightly</p>
